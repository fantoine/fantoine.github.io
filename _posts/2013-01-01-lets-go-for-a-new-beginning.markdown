Today is a big day...and maybe **THE** big day! Today, is the first day of 2014 (Happy New year!!) but it especially marks the beginning of my new career as **an independant developer and entrepreneur**! Yep, sir! And with all the adventures and challenges which come in the package, please.

For the last past years, I worked on French IT Services companies and had great experiences since I mainly worked on R&D projects. I must admit that some projects were more interesting than others, but this is life, isn’t it?

Then in your life,  there comes a time when you want to do what you like, and definitely, it was something else for me. Indeed, working for other people is interesting (or maybe not, depending on the people...) but working for yourself is so much more gratifying. Since I was a teenager I always wanted to create my own software and games, and this is the good occasion to try myself to this activity.

I made this website and blog for different goals. Firstly, it’s a way for me to explains who I am and to share my projects. Secondly, I would like to be able to share some tutorials and technical experiments I will create. But it’s also a way to share my thought about this new professionnal state and this great experience.

I hope this website will bring you some interesting things. See you later!
