It’s been a long time since the first post on this blog and I didn’t post anything else. Well, I was quite busy, but now it’s time to really start.

So, I started to work on some visual identity for my website and then created the following logos. I created 2 versions of it: one with just an icon and an other with the website full name. Both are available  in white-on-blue or blue-on-white colors.

<img src="{{ site.baseUrl }}/img/posts/its-time-for-a-new-logo/icon-blue.png" alt="blue" width="300" height="300" class="article-image center-image" />

<img src="{{ site.baseUrl }}/img/posts/its-time-for-a-new-logo/logo-white.png" alt="white" width="616" height="216" class="article-image center-image" />
