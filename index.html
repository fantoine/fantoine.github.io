        <p>I am <em>Fabien Antoine</em>, a developer and designer, based near Valence, France.</p>
        <p>In past years, I had the opportunity to work on different projects, mainly web-oriented, but affecting many and varied fields of activities. R&amp;D has always been my main activity but today I decided to get into an adventure where I could take advantage of different ideas running through my head, in a more personal way.</p>
        <p>I particularly enjoy working on complex but creative projects, while using innovative technologies. I also like to improve myself constantly and discover new concepts, and for that I regularly launches personal challenges to squeeze out the best of me. Thus, this blog is as an effective way to share my discoveries.</p>
